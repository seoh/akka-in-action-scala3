Akka in Action Example
---

### Purpose and Goal
1. Practice example code of Akka in Action book
  - with Scala 3 syntax and akka 2.6
  - at first, keep as-is code as possible and use akka classic style
2. Port to Scala 3
  - use Scala 3 features as possible like `given`
3. Port to modern Akka
  - refactor to `Behavior` pattern

### Structure
1. Each subproject is an example of own chapter
2. If ported to scala 3-ish, it will be ends with '3'
3. If ported to modern akka, it will be ends with '3b'
